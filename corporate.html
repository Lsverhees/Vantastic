          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
		  <h2 class="mt-1 small-heading"><em>Campaign</em></h2>
          <p>Campaign Vantastic is a brand for people aged 25 to 45 who live in their van full-time or part-time and who are looking for adventure, freedom and simplicity. Vantastic’s marketing campaign combines practical and inspiring content shared through posts, stories and reels on Instagram. The message of our campaign is that vanlife can be easy and fun, wherever your journey takes you. The content is designed to be relatable, adventurous, fun, and to make life on the road easier. Our vision is to inspire a world where van life is effortless, freeing, and truly adventurous. To maintain consistency and strengthen our brand identity, we have used the same colour palette across all our posts (brown, grey and green).</p>
		  <h2 class="mt-1 small-heading"><em>Objectives</em></h2>
          <p>To ensure the success of our Vantastic marketing campaign, we have established the following key objectives that will guide our content and engagement strategy:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Reach<br>
• By the 13th of April 2025, we aim to reach 100 unique Instagram users with brand content by posting 3x per week. This will help us increase brand awareness and expand our reach within the vanlife community.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Response<br>
• By the 13th of April 2025, we want to receive a total of 150 likes and 50 comments across all Instagram posts. These engagement metrics will help us measure how well our content resonates with our audience and fosters interaction within our community.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Affect<br>
            • By the 13th of April 2025, we want our audience to feel deeply connected to our brand, leaving them excited and eager for more after each post. Our goal is to foster a sense of community and adventure through engaging content that strengthens our audience's connection to Vantastic, whether it's about cooking, vanlife, or the freedom of the open road. By inspiring curiosity and excitement, we want our followers to see Vantastic as essential to their journey, leading them to purchase our cookbook as the perfect tool to enhance their vanlife experience.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>These objectives are crafted to not only measure our performance but also to ensure that every piece of content we create helps build a more engaged and loyal Vantastic community. By consistently analyzing our results, we’ll refine our strategy to stay aligned with both our brand goals and the changing needs of our audience. &nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="mt-1 small-heading"><em>Channels/platforms</em></h2>
          <p>Our target audience consists of individuals aged 25 to 45 who live part-time or full-time in their vans, seeking adventure, freedom, and simplicity. According to CBS (2020), 96% of people in this age group actively use social media. To effectively engage with this audience, we've chosen Instagram as our platform. Notably, 33% of Instagram users are between the ages of 28 and 43 (Meeuwissen, 2025), which aligns perfectly with our target demographic.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Campervan enthusiasts are highly active on Instagram. The hashtag #vanlife, for example, was used 6.5 million times in January 2020 (De Boer, 2020), and that number has now surged to 17.8 million. This rapid growth highlights the increasing popularity of the vanlife community. For us, this presents an opportunity to use Instagram to gain brand visibility and connect with an increasingly large, engaged audience.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Additionally, according to De Haas (2025), the best time to post on Instagram is between 7:00 and 9:00 AM on weekdays, when people quickly scroll through their feed before going to work. Also between 11:00 and 14:00 PM, right before lunch, many users are on Instagram to relax. Therefore, we decided to post during these peak times to generate the most engagement. &nbsp;</p>
