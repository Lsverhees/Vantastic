          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
		  <h2 class="mt-1 small-heading"><em>Campaign</em></h2>
          <p>Campaign Vantastic is a brand for people aged 25 to 45 who live in their van full-time or part-time and who are looking for adventure, freedom and simplicity. Vantastic’s marketing campaign combines practical and inspiring content shared through posts, stories and reels on Instagram. The message of our campaign is that vanlife can be easy and fun, wherever your journey takes you. The content is designed to be relatable, adventurous, fun, and to make life on the road easier. Our vision is to inspire a world where van life is effortless, freeing, and truly adventurous. To maintain consistency and strengthen our brand identity, we have used the same colour palette across all our posts (brown, grey and green).</p>
		  <h2 class="mt-1 small-heading"><em>Objectives</em></h2>
          <p>To ensure the success of our Vantastic marketing campaign, we have established the following key objectives that will guide our content and engagement strategy:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Reach<br>
• By the 13th of April 2025, we aim to reach 100 unique Instagram users with brand content by posting 3x per week. This will help us increase brand awareness and expand our reach within the vanlife community.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Response<br>
• By the 13th of April 2025, we want to receive a total of 150 likes and 50 comments across all Instagram posts. These engagement metrics will help us measure how well our content resonates with our audience and fosters interaction within our community.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Affect<br>
            • By the 13th of April 2025, we want our audience to feel deeply connected to our brand, leaving them excited and eager for more after each post. Our goal is to foster a sense of community and adventure through engaging content that strengthens our audience's connection to Vantastic, whether it's about cooking, vanlife, or the freedom of the open road. By inspiring curiosity and excitement, we want our followers to see Vantastic as essential to their journey, leading them to purchase our cookbook as the perfect tool to enhance their vanlife experience.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>These objectives are crafted to not only measure our performance but also to ensure that every piece of content we create helps build a more engaged and loyal Vantastic community. By consistently analyzing our results, we’ll refine our strategy to stay aligned with both our brand goals and the changing needs of our audience. &nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="mt-1 small-heading"><em>Channels/platforms</em></h2>
          <p>Our target audience consists of individuals aged 25 to 45 who live part-time or full-time in their vans, seeking adventure, freedom, and simplicity. According to CBS (2020), 96% of people in this age group actively use social media. To effectively engage with this audience, we've chosen Instagram as our platform. Notably, 33% of Instagram users are between the ages of 28 and 43 (Meeuwissen, 2025), which aligns perfectly with our target demographic.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Campervan enthusiasts are highly active on Instagram. The hashtag #vanlife, for example, was used 6.5 million times in January 2020 (De Boer, 2020), and that number has now surged to 17.8 million. This rapid growth highlights the increasing popularity of the vanlife community. For us, this presents an opportunity to use Instagram to gain brand visibility and connect with an increasingly large, engaged audience.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Additionally, according to De Haas (2025), the best time to post on Instagram is between 7:00 and 9:00 AM on weekdays, when people quickly scroll through their feed before going to work. Also between 11:00 and 14:00 PM, right before lunch, many users are on Instagram to relax. Therefore, we decided to post during these peak times to generate the most engagement. &nbsp;</p>

          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-2">Learning Points</h4>
  <p>To discuss what our learning points are, we first look at our Instagram statistics to get a clear insight of the entire journey.</p>

  <!-- Week 1 -->
 <h2 class="mt-1 small-heading"><em>Week 1 (17 – 23 March)</em></h2>
  <table>

      <tr><td>Profile Visits</td><td>63</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Interactions</td><td>43</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>In Week 1, we posted 3 times, and the campaign started with good engagement, resulting in 142 views and 43 interactions, mainly from followers (75.6%). The 63 profile visits showed initial curiosity, and the interaction of non-followers was not disappointing (24.4%). However, we needed to explore ways to attract new users, possibly through different content formats or hashtags.</p>

  <!-- Week 2 -->
			 <h2 class="mt-1 small-heading"><em>Week 2 (24 – 30 March)</em></h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Metric</th>
        <th>Results</th>
      </tr>

      <tr><td>Profile Visits</td><td>67</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Interactions</td><td>65</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>Week 2 had 2 posts, 1 reel, and 4 stories. This combination led to significant growth in reach, with 425 views and 65 interactions, primarily from followers (93.1%). The profile visits increased to 67, indicating interest in our content. However, the engagement from non-followers (6.9%) was lower than expected. The reel likely helped boost visibility, but we needed to work on attracting a broader audience.</p>

  <!-- Week 3 -->
<h2 class="mt-1 small-heading"><em>Week 3 (31 March – 6 April)</em></h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Metric</th>
        <th>Results</th>

      <tr><td>Profile Visits</td><td>16</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Interactions</td><td>42</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>In Week 3, we posted 3 times and 1 story. We saw a drop in reach (248 views) and profile visits (16), which suggests the content may not have been as engaging as before. Despite high interaction from followers (93%), non-followers showed minimal interest (7%). This could be due to content fatigue. So here too, we needed to work on more variety.</p>

  <!-- Week 4 -->
<h2 class="mt-1 small-heading"><em>Week 4 (7 – 13 April)</em></h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Metric</th>

    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Views</td><td>446</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Accounts Reached</td><td>174</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Accounts Engaged</td><td>18</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Profile Visits</td><td>27</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Interactions</td><td>43</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>In week 4 we posted 1 post, 2 reels and 1 story. This combination resulted in 446 views and a strong reach of 174 accounts, our best so far. What stood out was the more balanced distribution of the audience, 46.6% of the views came from non-followers. In this week we saw that reels definitely work best for us and that we get the biggest reach with them.</p>
			
<h2 class="mt-1 small-heading"><em>Tackbacks</em></h2>
<p>Firstly, we didn’t fully achieve the goals we set for this campaign. We aimed to receive 150 likes and 50 comments and reach 100 unique Instagram users with our branded content. In the end, we achieved a total of 132 likes and 26 comments, and reached 54 followers. Most of the interactions came from existing followers, which showed a strong community connection, but also a clear challenge in growing our audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the key things we learned is that the format of the content has a huge impact on how well something performs. Reels clearly outperformed other types of content, driving more reach and engagement. Stories are useful for staying visible, but don’t deliver much on their own. What worked best was a smart mix, especially posting reels at the same time as stories. In week 2, we saw this very clearly: with just 2 regular posts, 1 reel, and 4 stories, we got 425 views and 65 interactions, one of the highest of the entire campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we expected was right: diverse and lively content drove better results. In week 4 we posted 1 post, 2 reels and 1 story. This combination resulted in 446 views and a strong reach of 174 accounts, our best so far. This showed that diverse content worked what we expected. We also expected that videos would work the best, in week 2 and 4 we posted reels, which resulted in the best views.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What didn’t go as expected was that posting at the ‘best times’ had less effect than expected. Even when we stuck to the recommended times, we didn’t get more engagement. In addition, we expected to have more followers. Our goal was to reach 100 unique Instagram, unfortunately we only got 54. On the other hand, this shows that at least 54 people are interested in us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A standout moment was a single static post that clearly explained our product. That post was viewed 130 times, well above the average of 20 views for our other posts. It was a clear reminder that clarity and a valuable message are important. People respond when the content directly addresses their interests and questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the future, we would focus much more on reels and try different types of content, like behind-the-scenes videos, interactive stories, and polls. We would also test paid promotions to reach more people. By closely monitoring the results, we can quickly respond to what works and what doesn’t, and adjust that on a weekly basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another important lesson is that we need to look beyond Instagram. It’s a great platform to build a recognizable style and engage with followers, but we’ve noticed that it’s not the best place to really reach a lot of new people. That’s why it would be smart to explore other platforms, like TikTok (great for short videos), or Facebook or Pinterest, depending on what fits our brand. Each platform has its own opportunities, and by not focusing everything on Instagram, we increase our chances of reaching a wider audience. Also we will focus more on videos as it has proven to work well for our brand.</p>
<p>We didn’t achieve all of our goals, but this campaign taught us a lot about what our audience likes and where we can improve. The insights we gained about things like content types, messaging, timing, and which platforms we use are really valuable. These lessons will be important as we look to build our online presence and run better, more effective campaigns in the future. </p>

          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>Although our recent campaign did not fully achieve all of our goals, we learned a lot that will help us improve in the future. If we were to continue the project, we would take a different approach based on what we’ve learned. With this in mind, we’ve set new, more refined objectives to help us grow stronger and reach a wider audience moving forward.&nbsp;</p>
		  <h2 class="mt-1 small-heading"><em>Our new objectives</em></h2>
          <p>Reach <br>
            •	By the 2nd of June 2025, we aim to reach 400 unique users across Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Response<br>
            •	By the 2nd of June 2025, we want to receive 600 likes and 200 comments across all Instagram, TikTok and Facebook posts.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Affect <br>
            •	By the 2nd  of June 2025, we want our audience to feel deeply connected to our brand, leaving them excited and eager for more after each post.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We changed our objectives because we’re now focusing on more platforms, not just Instagram, but also TikTok and Facebook. By sharing our content in more places, we hope to reach more people and get more engagement. That’s why our new reach and response goals are higher: we want to reach 400 different users and receive 500 likes and 150 comments across all platforms by the 2nd of June 2025. We want more people to see, like, and interact with our posts. We decided to keep the same affect objective because it’s still really important to us that people feel connected to our brand. No matter where they see our posts, we want them to feel excited and interested in what we share.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2 class="mt-1 small-heading"><em>What we will do to reach these objectives:</em></h2>
          <p>1.	Focus more on reels and video content <br>
            We learned that Reels and video content are great for driving engagement and reach. We will create more diverse videos, such as a day in the life/ what I eat in a day of a vanlifer, “This or that” vanlife editions, challenges (like cooking with only 3 ingredients or no power for a day). Videos such as Q&amp;A sessions or tutorials (like how to shower or do laundry on the road). In all the cook videos, One Pan Wonder recipes will be used. We will  post at least three video-based posts per week.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>2.	Use paid promotions <br>
            To grow our audience faster, we would try Instagram, Tiktok and Facebook paid promotions. This allows us to advertise specifically to our target group. This will get our content on the feed of people who are already interested in vanlife-related content and on those in our age group (25-45).</p>
          <p>3.	Expand to other platforms <br>
            We have focused on Instagram, but we are going to explore other platforms for a wider reach. For this we want to post on Tiktok, we have noticed that short videos are well received, so we think it is a good idea to continue this on Tiktok. Here we will use trends in the field of music and challenges. We will also advertise on Facebook, to attract even more people from our target group.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>4.	More interaction with non-followers <br>
            Most of our interaction came from current followers, but we need to reach new people. For this we want to use more specific hashtags such as #campervankitchen and #vanlifeadventures to reach the right target group. We will also be working with Van Life influencers like @keithandhannahh, who have over 30K followers, which is a perfect fit for our target audience.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>5.	Post more at different times <br>
            As we mentioned before we stuck to certain post times because we thought this would work best, so we only posted during these times, between 7:00 and 9:00 AM and between 11:00 and 14:00 PM. We assumed that these times worked best, and therefore didn't try anything else. We now plan to test various time slots, including evenings (after 6 PM), to identify when our audience is most active. This will help us maximize reach and interaction.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In short, we are refining our content strategy by posting more video content (like Reels and TikToks), using paid promotions, expanding to new platforms, engaging more with non-followers, and posting between more different times throughout the day. By trying new things and learning from every post, we hopefully build a larger, more engaged community for Vantastic and helping more people enjoy their vanlife journey. </p>
